Java

Problem


In a certain business sector there are currently N small companies, each having just a single employee. These employees are numbered 1 through N.

The business sector is about to be transformed into a monopoly. This will happen through a series of mergers, until there is only one company. A single merger involves two companies. In a merger, the president of one company becomes the direct report of the president of the other company, preserving the rest of the hierarchies of both companies.

You will be given the descriptions of all mergers. Depending on how they are performed (which of the two presidents involved becomes the president of the new company), the hierarchy can of the final company can take different shapes. We want the hierarchy of the final company to be as shallow as possible. The task is to find the smallest possible number of levels in the final hierarchy.

There is also a limit D on the number of direct reports any employee can have. Because of this limit, there may be only one way to accomplish a certain merger, or it might even be impossible. However, there will always be some way to accomplish all the mergers.

Input
The first line contains the number of test cases T.

Each test case starts with a blank line. The next line contains two integers, N and D.

Each of the following N-1 lines describes a single merger, with two integers between 1 and N. These are the employees whose companies are merging. The two employees will never already be part of the same company.

The mergers must be performed in the order in which they are given.

Constraints
5 ≤ T ≤ 20
2 ≤ N ≤ 30000
1 ≤ D ≤ 5000
The input test cases will be such that it is possible to accomplish all mergers.
Output
For each of the test cases numbered in order from 1 to T, output "Case #i: " followed by a single integer, the smallest number of levels in the final hierarchy.

Examples
In the first example, we have N=3 and D=2. The first merger happens between the companies of employees 1 and 2. In the resulting company we can have employee 1 as the president with 2 as his report, or vice versa. Next this company merges with the company of employee 3. If we have employee 3 become the president, the hierarchy will be a chain 3-1-2 or 3-2-1. If 1 or 2 become the president, that president will have the other two employees as direct reports. This last hierarchy has two levels.
