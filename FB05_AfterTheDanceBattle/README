Problem

Walking home in triumph after a particularly satisfying dance battle, you take a wrong turn into an alley and find yourself presented with a perplexing puzzle. The entrance to the alley behind you disappears and you are faced with a rectangular grid of colorful squares, with thick granite walls occupying some of the squares. The grid is recessed far enough into the ground that, from above, you can see the exit in the distance and the layout of all the colors. You can memorize the entire layout before entering the grid and trying to make your way across.

As you stand above the grid trying to commit its layout to memory, you notice something strange about the urban wildlife trapped with you in the maze; the various fauna seem to be able to move almost instantaneously between squares of the same color. You suspect that you can use this property to your advantage, which you attempt to keep at the front of your mind as you enter the labyrinth with your intentions set on getting out as quickly as possible.

Input
Your input file will consist of a number N followed by some whitespace and then N test cases. Each case consists of two numbers R and C, the number of rows and columns in the maze, followed by R strings describing the layout of the rows in order. All tokens are whitespace-separated.

Each element describing a row will consist of the characters 'S', 'E', 'W', or the digits 0-9. There will be only one 'S' square and one 'E' square, 'S' being your starting point and 'E' being the exit. 'S' will be in the first row, 'E' will be in the last row. 'W' squares are occupied by walls, and cannot be entered. Digits 1-9 represent the colors of the squares. You can pass in a single step between adjacent squares or between any two squares of the same color. The start and exit points as well as all '0' squares are inert, i.e., they have no color and must be stepped directly on to or off of. There will always be some valid method of reaching the exit.

Output
Return the number of steps required to reach the exit from the starting point.
