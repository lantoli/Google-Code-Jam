Problem

As a top driver in European racing circles, you find yourself taking more than your fair share of risks. You go into every race knowing it may be your last, but generally with the suspicion it won't be. Today, however, may turn out to be different. The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile has sanctioned a new track in the Bernese Alps that may prove to be death of anyone that dares brave its tight, awkwardly-banked turns and cliff-adjacent straightaways.

Since you are a professional racing driver, you have considerable financial backing and support in preparing for your first race on this new course. A veritable consortium of physicists, software engineers, and drivers more expendable than yourself have determined, for each corner on the track, the probability of crashing during normal fast-paced driving and the probability of crashing during an overtake maneuver. A single crash will end the race for you. It is left to you to use this information to formulate your overall racing strategy.

The race you will participate in will include R racers including yourself. Given your history of apparently effortlessly cruising past all opponents to victory, you will be starting at the rear of the pack to keep things interesting. You must use your knowledge of the track to get to first place by the time you have passed through the final turn. You can only overtake opponents during a turn, so you must choose the R-1 turns during which to overtake that will maximize your likelihood of finishing the race. This isn't the charitable sort of racing that awards accolades like "second place", so your only goal here is to defeat every single opponent.

Input
Your input file will begin with a single integer N, the number of test cases to follow, followed by a newline. Each test case begins with a single line containing two integers, R as specified above and T, the number of turns on the track. Following this will be T pairs of integers where the ith pair represents the likelihood of crashing while overtaking and the likelihood of crashing during normal driving, respectively during the ith turn. For each of these integers p, consider the probability of the corresponding event to be 1/p.

Output
Output, for each test case, the reduced fraction representing the probability that you will win the race. Your outputs should be separated only by whitespace.

Constraints
10 <= N <= 30
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= R < T
1 <= p <= 500
