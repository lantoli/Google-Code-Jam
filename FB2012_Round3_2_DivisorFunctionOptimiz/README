Problem

Let d(N) be the number of positive divisors of positive integer N. Consider the infinite sequence x(n) = d(n)^a / n^b, n = 1, 2, 3, … where a and b are fixed positive integers. It can be shown that this sequence tends to zero. Hence it attains its maximum. Denote it by p/q where p and q are co-prime positive integers. Your task is for given a and b find p and q modulo M = 109+7. But to keep input and output small you will be given tuples (b1; b2; a1; a2; c) and need to calculate the sum of (p mod M) for all pairs (a; b) such that b1 ≤ b ≤ b2, a1 ≤ a ≤ a2 and a ≤ c*b, and the same sum for q-values.

Input
The first line contains a positive integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains five space separated positive integers b1, b2, a1, a2 and c.

Output
For each of the test cases numbered in order from 1 to T, output "Case #i: " followed by a space separated pair of integers: the sum of (p mod M) for all pairs (a; b) mentioned above and the sum of (q mod M) for all such pairs. Note that you need to find the sum of residues not the residue of sum (see testcase 3 as a reference).

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 20
1 ≤ b1 ≤ b2 ≤ 10000
1 ≤ a1 ≤ a2 ≤ 250000
1 ≤ c ≤ 25
in each testcase the total number of pairs (a; b) for which the answer should be calculated does not exceed 100000
